## 👁 What is Lorayis?

**Lorayis** is a vision system built to uncover what lies beneath the surface.  
Patterns, distortions, signals — hidden in plain sight.  

It doesn’t just analyze images.  
It questions them.

---

## 🌌 Why It Exists

In a world flooded with pixels, Lorayis was designed to see beyond them.  
To reveal what’s been lost, altered, or waiting to be noticed.

Whether it's anomaly detection, abstract pattern emergence, or subtle visual tampering —  
**Lorayis looks where others don't.**
